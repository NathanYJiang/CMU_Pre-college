Project Proposal

Project Description:
My term project is named Settlers of Ketan and it will be a reimplementation of
the board game Settlers of Catan.

Similar Projects:
I've taken a look at many other 15-112 TP Catan remakes, and they all have some sort of 
basic hexagonal grid, settlements/cities, resources, and other stuff necessary
for a simple implementation of Catan. My project will have these features 
in common, and additional features I will implement include trading and
longest road/army. I hope to make the user experience smooth with little to no
difficulties for new players.

Structural Plan:
I will organize my code into different folders, like a classes folder, an 
images folder, and a utils folder. I'll make sure that my code is organized, 
with style and classes to make sure my code is understandable.

Algorithmic Plan:
I will approach the trickiest part of the project, which will most likely be 
calculating the longest road, by reading over the pathfinding guide and 
consulting my TP mentor whenever necessary.

Timeline Plan:
I will first finish up the board setup and work on cards by TP1. Then I'll 
create the game mechanics and buttons for turn based play by TP2, so it can
be a playable game (MVP). Afterwards, I'll work on the user experience and 
whatever other complex features like trading/longest road calculations I can 
get done by TP3.

Version Control Plan:
I have backed up my code on GitHub:

Module List:
I am not planning to use any additional modules.
