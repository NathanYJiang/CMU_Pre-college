Project Proposal

Project Description:
My term project is named Settlers of Ketan and it will be a reimplementation of
the board game Settlers of Catan.

Similar Projects:
I've taken a look at many other 15-112 TP Catan remakes, and they all have some sort of 
basic hexagonal grid, settlements/cities, resources, and other stuff necessary
for a simple implementation of Catan. 

My project will have these features 
in common, but I will implement trading, longest road/army, and 

Structural Plan:
I will organize my code into different folders, like a classes folder, an images
folder, and a utils folder. 

Algorithmic Plan:
I will approach the trickiest part of the project, which will most likely be 
calculating the longest road, by reading over the pathfinding guide and 
consulting my TP mentor whenever necessary.

Timeline Plan:
I will follow the TP timeline.

Version Control Plan:
I have backed up my code on GitHub: 
https://github.com/NathanYJiang/CMU_Pre-college.

Module List:
I am not planning to use any additional modules.
